# Contributing guidelines

# Reporting broken sites

Report broken websites using the "Report Broken Site" link on the extension popup.

# Reporting bugs

1. First check to see if the bug has not already been [reported](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues).
2. Create a bug report [issue](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

# Feature requests

There are two ways to submit feedback:
1. You can send anonymous feedback using the "Send feedback" link on the extension's options page.
2. You can submit your request as an [issue](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). First check to see if the feature has not already been [suggested](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues).

# Development

## New features

Right now all new feature development is handled internally.

## Bug fixes

Most bug fixes are handled internally, but we will except pull requests for bug fixes if you first:
1. Create an issue describing the bug. see [Reporting bugs](CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs)
2. Get approval from DDG staff before working on it. Since most bug fixes and feature development are handled internally, we want to make sure that your work doesn't conflict with any current projects.

## Testing locally

### Pre-Requisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installation
- [Grunt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt)
- Tests use [Selenium Webdriver](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).

### Building the extension
- Firefox
 1. Run `npm run dev-firefox`
 2. Load the extension in Firefox from the `build/firefox/dev` directory
[Temporary installation in Firefox - Mozilla | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox)
    Alternatively running `web-ext run -s build/firefox/dev` loads the extension into a temporary profile.

- Chrome
 1. Run `npm run dev-chrome`
 2. Load the extension in Chrome from the `build/chrome/dev` directory
[Getting Started: Building a Chrome Extension - Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

- Safari

  The Safari extension is no longer supported.

### Development flow

The `shared` directory contains JS, CSS, and images that are shared by all browsers.

The popup UI is in `shared/js/ui`

The background JS is in `shared/js/`

Browser specific files, including manifest files, are located in `browsers/<browser-name>`

Run the dev build task for your browser from the 'Build' section above. The generated build files are located in `/build/<browser>/dev`.

After running the build task it will continue watching for changes to any of the source files. After saving any changes to these files it will automatically rebuild the `dev` directory for you.

### Testing
- Unit tests: `npm test`
- Integration Tests
  - Local, requires Chrome: `npm run test-int`
    - You can filter to one test with: `KEEP_OPEN=1 npm run test-int -- -f integration-test/background/test-fp-fingerprint.js`
  - Headless, requires xvfb: `npm run test-ci`

### Selenium Testing (ratings.js)

**Setup**

1. For remote linux machine, first setup xvfb: `source selenium-test/setup.sh`
2. `npm install`
3. `grunt`

**Testing Single Site** `./selenium-test/ratings.js -u https://website.com`

**Testing Top 500** `./selenium-test/ratings.js -n 2` (where n = [1 - 500])

**Testing Multiple Sites** `./selenium-test/ratings.js -f urls.txt` (file should have 1 url on each line)

**Using XVFB** To test on a remote server with XVBF installed, add `-x` flag: `./selenium-test/ratings.js -x -u https://website.com`

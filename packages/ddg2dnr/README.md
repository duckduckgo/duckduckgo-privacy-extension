## Introduction

This is a library and command line utility to generate the [declarativeNetRequest][1]
rulesets necessary for the [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension][2].


## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Command line

Generate a Smarter Encryption ruleset:

```bash
npm run smarter-encryption ../list-of-domains-input.txt ../smarter-encryption-ruleset-output.json
```

Generate the TDS ruleset:

```bash
npm run tds ../tds-input.json ../supported-surrogates-input.json ../tds-ruleset-output.json \
        [../allowing-rules-by-ctl-action-output.json] [../match-details-by-rule-id-output.json]
```

Note:
 - This includes both Tracker blocking (see [tds.json][3]) and
   "surrogate script" redirection. (see [tracker-surrogates][4]).
 - supported-surrogates-input.json must be a JSON encoded array of surrogate
   script names.

Generate the extension configuration ruleset:

```bash
npm run extension-configuration ../extension-config-input.json \
        ../extension-configuration-ruleset-output.json [../match-details-by-rule-id-output.json]
```

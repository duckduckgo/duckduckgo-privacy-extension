    <h2>You're Protected From Social Media Tracking</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Social media companies leverage their reach and content to encourage other web sites to include things like videos, comments, or login on their pages. Unfortunately, when a site embeds something from a social media company (like a facebook video), it also includes tracking code to link that browsing information with the viewers profile on the social network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, this might be what you want. For instance, when playing a social game with your facebook account. But other times you might prefer to visit sites without them being linked to your social media profile, such as when reading medical information or viewing controversial news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a site tries to load something from facebook, whether it's a video to show, an ability to view and post comments on an article, or logging in with your facebook account, DuckDuckGo will automatically block it from loading unless you explicitly enable it. You can feel safe and secure browsing, knowing that you're protected.
